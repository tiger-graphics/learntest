### Solution
A straight line in simple logarithmic representation with a logarithmic y-axis is described by an exponential function.  
Since the line slopes downward, $Y(x)= b \cdot e^{-a \cdot x}$ with $a>0$.  
The value for $b$ can be read from the graph at the point $x=0$, since this is where $e^{-a \cdot x}=1$.    
In this case, $b=600$.
